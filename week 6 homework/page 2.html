    <h3>A Short Story</h3>
    <br>
    I don't know what to write for a short story, so I will leave you with my favorite poem instead.
    <br>
    <h4>Ithaka by C. P. Cavafy</h4>
    As you set out for Ithaka<br>
hope your road is a long one,<br>
full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:<br>
you’ll never find things like that on your way<br>
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>
as long as a rare excitement<br>
stirs your spirit and your body.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them<br>
unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.<br>
<br>
Hope your road is a long one.<br>
May there be many summer mornings when,<br>
with what pleasure, what joy,<br>
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;<br>
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>
to buy fine things,<br>
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>
sensual perfume of every kind—<br>
as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>
and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.<br>
<br>
Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br>
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.<br>
But don’t hurry the journey at all.<br>
Better if it lasts for years,<br>
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,<br>
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,<br>
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.<br>
<br>
Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br>
Without her you wouldn't have set out.<br>
She has nothing left to give you now.<br>
<br>
And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.<br>
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.<br>
